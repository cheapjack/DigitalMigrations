## Adventures In Text

Simple excursion into `JavaScript` with help from the Mozilla Foundation

Based on [@cheapjack](https://twitter.com/cheapjack)'s work on [Interactive Non-Fiction](https://gitlab.com/DomesticScience/InteractiveNonFiction).

`JavaScript` is a dynamic programming language built into the web similar to [p5](https://p5js.org/) and processing (although its more like the other way round). Don't forget to browse and hack your way through thousands of people's code at [OpenProcessing](http://openprocessing.org)

You can download this whole repository and then hack away at the contents of the `/adventuresintext` directory.

It's based on this [Silly Story Generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Silly_story_generator) tutorial by hris Mills at Mozilla.
