Thinking of data as a practice means you can make present and manipulate text and images in interactive ways. 

The most ubiquitous space for manipulating and presenting data is the humble old webpage built on the `HTML` protocol. It's on our phones and laptops and computers. It's even at our supermarket till and sometimes not even connected to a screen.

We are going to hack an example webpage that uses `HTML` `CSS` and `JavaScript` to display a random image and glue together strings of text.

This tutorial is written by my pal [Chris Mills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/profiles/chrisdavidmills) who is a senior writer at [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org) and really cares for the web and it's potential. If at the end of this you want to learn more I heartily recommend his and his colleagues [tutorials on Getting Started With the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web).

I'd also *always* refer to the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) if you ever want to know how to do or use anything on the web (especially if you want it made by people who really care for their community and the internet and hate advert filled webpages. If you followed their tutorials and learnt [Open Processing](https://www.openprocessing.org/) you are well on your way to having all the data and creative coding skills to develop nuanced, meaningful and powerful digital work and participate in creative digital culture. Well for as long as the internet is still turned on all the time, anyway.

This tutorial is based on the [JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) tutorial Chris and co. made, so it may be worth returning to in detail. For us we are going to make a really simple web pages that:

 * Randomly picks from 3 images every time you click on the image
 * Asks **"Who's Reading"** in a text box and then addresses this person in a block of text
 * Provides an `Add to Story` Button which provides a prompt in the web page where you can add as many strings of text you like, which gets saved in a `variable` in the web page's `JavaScript` file 

First off have a play with the finished webpage [here](adventuresintext/index.html)

Now download the [DigitalMigrations repository](https://github.com/cheapjack/DigitalMigrations) to the Desktop and have a look at these two files in a text editor

`DigitalMigrations/adventuresintext/index.html` and `DigitalMigrations/adventuresintext/main.js`

Don't worry if this is all new and looks crazily complicated, I'm going to guide you through hacking these 2 files to make them your own. You'll soon be generating stuff like our friend Snorpy from the first Class. You are going to understand what you can change to make it your own and I'll introduce some of the concepts best I can. I'm not a programmer I've just become literate in some of the basics and picked up resources that help people and help me do things that are useful in my practice and research.

By the end you will have picked up an introduction to how we can play with webpages to make work, present the other skills we learnt last class and generally sketch things out using the web browser as canvas. 

All of this course content is available and downloadable from the [DigitalMigrations github](https://github.com/cheapjack/DigitalMigrations)

That's enough html lets turn images into sound, play with the sound and turn the sound back into an image. Let's do databending!
