Thinking of data as a practice means you can make present and manipulate text and images in interactive ways. 

The most ubiquitous space for manipulating and presenting data is the humble old webpage built on the `HTML` protocol. It's on our phones and laptops and computers. It's even at our supermarket till and sometimes not even connected to a screen.

We are going to hack an example webpage that uses `HTML` `CSS` and `JavaScript` to display a random image and glue together strings of text.

First off have a play with the finished webpage [here](adventuresintext/index.html)

Now have a look at these two files in a text editor
`index.html` and `main.js`
