## Further Explorations

### Throw More Data Shapes

[Matt DesLauriers AKA @mattdesl](https://twitter.com/mattdesl) made some really nice tutorials for wome [@shapeofdata](https://twitter.com/shapeofdata) workshops. It uses the [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) platform and is really good for seeing what we've learnt entangled with contemporary javascript.

### The Nature Of Code

You can learn some really advanced stuff by following the course materials from the [Nature of Code}(https://natureofcode.com/book/)

It's made for using with the Processing application but [there are p5.js implementations here](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-examples-p5.js)

It's well worth working your way through if you really want to take this further as it helps you get to grips with working with object orientated programming in depth and adding simulations of natural like physics using forces and gravitation.
