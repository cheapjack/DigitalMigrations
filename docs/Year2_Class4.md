We are working our way through [the p5 Interactvity Page](https://p5js.org/learn/interactivity.html) and then we'll visit a bit more advanced stuff with Matt DesLauriers below.

## Tables!

The table or humble spreadsheet is one of the most simple and oldest forms of organising data.

Computers can easily deal with tables translated into `.csv` files which stand for **C** ommma **S** eperated **V** alues. All spreadsheet software can export their data in this format and you'll find it in my [Data sources](#data-sources) section below.

### Bar Charts

[Tutorial](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/790798)

We are going to use some disturbing [real data](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/yemen-cholera-outbreak-daily-epidemiology-update/resource/06f74fb8-9194-476d-8d35-343f951c90f6?view_id=9e32d6b7-b4da-4fba-8299-e01fb26a93e9) of reported Cholera deaths in Syria to draw some graphs

### Maps and CSV

[Tutorial](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/790439)

Using `.csv` files with latitude and longitude data in them can be really effective.

This uses the `flights.csv` file to map out flight density.

We're going to then try different data sets


### Plotting

[Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)'s continues with some more sophisticated methods of plotting from files like this.

## Further Explorations

### Throw More Data Shapes

[Matt DesLauriers AKA @mattdesl](https://twitter.com/mattdesl) made some really nice tutorials for some [@shapeofdata](https://twitter.com/shapeofdata) workshops. It uses the [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) platform and is really good for seeing what we've learnt entangled with contemporary javascript.

### Computational Media

[Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)'s work on the NYU ITP [Foundation course in Computational Media](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2017), where Daniel Schiffman (founder of Processing) works

Also Allison runs the [Computational approaches to Narrative](http://catn.decontextualize.com/) syllabus

### The Nature Of Code

You can learn some really advanced stuff by following the course materials from the [Nature of Code}(https://natureofcode.com/book/)

It's made for using with the Processing application but [there are p5.js implementations here](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-examples-p5.js)

It's well worth working your way through if you really want to take this further as it helps you get to grips with working with object orientated programming in depth and adding simulations of natural like physics using forces and gravitation.

### Bots Should Punch Up

Taking data out onto social media is an interesting form of activism worth looking into. You'll notice that with an election looming in Dec 2019 and various regime change conflicts around the world the amount of bot activity is pretty intense. Got some data that might help deliberate over geopolitical power? Favourite poetry dumped into a `.csv` file?  Use it to power a twitter bot!

Start with  Leonard Richardson‚Äôs [Bots should punch up.](https://www.crummy.com/2013/11/27/0) and then browse all the content of [BotWiki](https://botwiki.org/)
